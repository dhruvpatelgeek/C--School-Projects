# Mobile Database Project
The following is a mobile phone managent project which demonstrates my understanding of OOP concepts
it has the follwing functions:

new_user
			
get_wifi
			
get_intl
			
all_user
			
sort_user_by_bal
			
sort_user_by_name

It stores the output in a txt file and access it using fstream
